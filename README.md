Here’s a rewritten `README.md` in **Markdown** format for your NYC 311 project:

# 📊 NYC 311 Data Project

A full-stack data science project built around NYC 311 service request data. The goal is to understand complaint patterns, engineer spatial features, and train machine learning models to predict potential hotspots.

---

## 🔧 Project Overview

### 1. **Data Ingestion**
- Data collected from the NYC Open Data API using an app token.
- Cleaned and stored in a MySQL database for efficient querying and access.

### 2. **Database Management**
- SQL scripts and Python automation to:
  - Set up the schema
  - Alter tables
  - Insert cleaned 311 data into MySQL

### 3. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**
- Conducted via SQL and Python (Pandas + Seaborn/Matplotlib)
- Trends by borough, complaint type, seasonality, and response time

### 4. **Geospatial Aggregation**
- H3 hex indexing applied to latitude/longitude
- Aggregated complaint counts by date and hex region for hotspot detection

### 5. **Machine Learning**
- Logistic Regression and Random Forest classifiers to predict hotspot areas
- Feature engineering includes temporal, spatial, and complaint metadata
- Evaluation using precision, recall, F1 score, and ROC AUC

## 📌 Notes

- **Sensitive Info:** Secrets like MySQL credentials and API tokens are stored in a `.env` file (excluded from version control via `.gitignore`).
- **Environment Management:** Project dependencies and configuration managed through virtual environments.
- **Reproducibility:** Modularized ETL, EDA, and ML pipelines make this project easy to extend and rerun.
